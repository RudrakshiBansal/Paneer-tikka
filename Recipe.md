1. To a mixing bowl, add:-
   6 Tablespoon thick curd.
   1 and 1.5 tablespoon red chili powder
   1/8 teaspoon turmeric
   half teaspoon coriander powder
   1 teaspoon garam masala
   half teaspoon chat masala

2. next add
   1/1/4 teaspoon ginger garlic paste
   1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi
   1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ajwain(carom seeds, optional)

 (optional:If making on grill or tawa add 1 tablespoon roasted besan. Dry roast besan until aromatic. It should lose the raw flavor, cool and add it. Or roast the besan in 1.5 tablespoon oil until fregrant and then cool it. Later mix with the marinade. Do not skip using besan it helps to hold the curd well to the paneer tikka. It also brings th  eout a good flavour and will avoid messing uo the tawa. This is done by many chefs for the extra flavour.)  

3. Add 1.5 tablespoon oil. I have used mustard oil, you can also use any other oil.

4. Mix everything well. The marinade must be thick. Taste the marinade and add salt and spices if needed.

5. Add capsicum and onions. Coat them well with the marinade.

6. Move the vegiies to one side of the bowl and add 200 grams cubed paneer and gently coat them as well. Handle with care they may break.

7. Cover and rest them in fridge for an hour. If you leave the for too long, sometimes they break when you thread them in the skewer on later. If you prefer to keep longer, thread them first and then keep in refrigerator.

8. Next begin to thread them in skewers. With the quantities mentioned in the recipe card you can thread them on 3 largers or 4 medium skewers.

9. If making on grill or tawa heat a tawa with 1 tablespoon oil. When it turns hot , place the skewers in the center and grill them on medium heat.

10. Finally turn them around to grill evenly until they turn gloden. Place a wired rack over direct fire like gas stove. Place these skewers over the fire and grill on direct flame until char grilled. This stepl will ensure all of the marinade is cooked through.

REMOVE PANEER TIKKA TO A SERVING PLATE, BRUSH THEM WITH BUTTER, SQUEEZE LEMIN JUICE AND SPRINKLE SOME CHAT MASALA IF YOU PREFER. SERVE PANEER TIKKA HOT WITH ONION LEMON WEDGES AND MINT CHUTNEY.


                           ENJOY PANEER TIKKA!!
